This experiment is made up of eight blocks of about six 
minutes. During each block, a total of ten images will 
appear, once every about 35 seconds. The images will be 
of either houses or faces and will remain on the screen 
for up to 15 seconds. 
Keep your eyes on the "+" sign in the center of the 
screen. From time to time the "+" will briefly turn into 
"-", and when this happens you should quickly press the 
response button.
